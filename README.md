# Rock Paper Scissor Game

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissor Game** repository! This project is an implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game written entirely in Ruby assisted by GitHub Copilot while learning GitHub Copilot Fundamentals.

## Features

- Intuitive and easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Two-player game mode against the computer or another human player.
- Randomized computer moves for a fair game.
- Clear and simple win/loss/draw logic.
